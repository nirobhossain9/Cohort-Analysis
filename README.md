## üìå Project Overview

Cohort analysis is a powerful tool for understanding customer lifecycle behavior by grouping users based on their first transaction date and tracking their activity over time.

In this project, we analyze:
- **Cohort performance by month**
- **Retention rate**
- **Churn rate**
- **Customer activity trends**

This dashboard was built using **Power BI** and provides interactive filtering options to explore trends across different periods.

## üìÖ Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Easily filter by date, cohort, and view metrics across 24 months since a customer‚Äôs first transaction.
- **Multiple Views**:
  - **Cohort Performance**: Total active customers in each month after their first purchase.
  - **Retention Rate**: Percentage of retained customers from each cohort.
  - **Churned Customer Count**: Monthly count of customers who became inactive.
  - **Churn Rate**: Monthly percentage of lost customers per cohort.
- **Timeline Filtering**: Select start and end dates to view cohort behavior during specific periods.

## üìà Insights Example (from the Dashboard)

- The **December 2009** cohort shows strong retention and performance with **473 customers** still active in the 12th month.
- Later cohorts, like **July 2011** onward, show fewer customers with shorter lifespans ‚Äî highlighting potential retention challenges.
- The dashboard makes it easy to identify peak performance months and cohorts with high drop-off rates.

Understanding retention and churn through cohort analysis helps businesses to:
- Identify which months or campaigns led to higher customer retention.
